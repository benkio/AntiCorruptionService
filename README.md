# Anti Corruption Service

The idea behind this service is to:

-   Practice Haskell & Web Development
-   Create an Anti Corruption Service between an external service and
    the api exposed.

In particular, we will use the service [punkapi](https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2) as external service.
Calling the *random beer* endpoint multiple times, we will collect
some data about random beers and we will return the data collected as
a single response (array) from the anti corruption layer API.
