* Anti Corruption Service

The idea behind this service is to:

- Practice Haskell & Web Development
- Create an Anti Corruption Service between an external service and
  the api exposed.

In particular, we will use the service [[https://punkapi.com/documentation/v2][punkapi]] as external service.
Calling the /random beer/ endpoint multiple times, we will collect
some data about random beers and we will return the data collected as
a single response (array) from the anti corruption layer API.
